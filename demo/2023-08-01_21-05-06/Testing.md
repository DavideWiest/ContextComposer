# Testing Module

## Overview
The Testing module is responsible for ensuring the quality and reliability of the app. It involves rigorous testing to identify and fix any issues or bugs before the app is released to the public. This module is crucial in ensuring that the app delivers a top-notch experience to users.

## Test Plan
The Test Plan outlines the approach and strategies for testing the app. It includes details on the test objectives, test scope, test environment, test deliverables, and test schedule. The Test Plan helps in organizing and executing the testing activities effectively.

## Test Cases
Test Cases are specific scenarios or conditions that are used to validate the functionality of the app. Each test case consists of a set of inputs, expected outputs, and preconditions. Test cases cover various aspects of the app, including user interface, functionality, performance, and security.

## Test Execution
The Test Execution phase involves running the test cases and recording the results. Testers execute the test cases as per the Test Plan and document any issues or bugs encountered during the testing process. The Test Execution phase helps in identifying and resolving any defects in the app.

## Defect Management
Defect Management involves tracking and managing the issues or bugs identified during testing. Testers log the defects in a defect tracking system, assign them to the development team, and track their resolution. Defect management ensures that all identified issues are addressed before the app is released.

## Regression Testing
Regression Testing is performed to ensure that the changes or fixes made to the app do not introduce new defects or impact existing functionality. It involves retesting the previously tested features to verify their stability. Regression testing helps in maintaining the overall quality of the app.

## Test Reports
Test Reports provide a summary of the testing activities and their results. These reports include information on the number of test cases executed, passed, and failed, along with any open defects. Test reports help in assessing the overall quality and readiness of the app for release.
